# Data Intelligence Analytics

 The data contain only quantitative variables. The first step is to explore this data using PCA. then applying a multiple regression model( with or without duration variable) 
 
 ## The "non linear" algorithm:
 
I used the Random forest model and the Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm. I tried to apply the gbm model only on the “train” data, but it is small , hence  I used  the “multiple” data.
 
 
 ## More to do
 
  the first time I saw the data and get the idea about the goal, first thing came to my mind was the design of experiments, not directly but it is related. Moreover, the approach of "sensitivity analysis" could be more helpful. .
